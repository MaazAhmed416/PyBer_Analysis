# PyBer Analysis
## Purpose of the new Analysis
As a starter, the purpose of the new analysis was to determine the total number of rides, drivers and fares in the three different types of cities. Also, to further understand the Fares/charges we found the average fare per ride and also the average fare per driver in the three diffferent types of cities. Furthermore, we determined what the weekly total fare was for the three different types of cities over a period of four months.

## Results of the Analysis
### Rural cities
The rural cities have the lowest number of total rides and total drivers. Based of our analysis, we determined that the total number of fares was also the lowest compared to other types of cities. However, due to the low number of total drivers and total rides, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver were the highest compared to other types of cities.

### Suburban cities
The suburban cities have a greater number of total rides and total drivers than the rural cities. Also, the total fares were higher than rural cities. After further analysis, we concluded that the average fare per ride and average fare per driver were both lower than the values of averages for rural cities.

### Urban cities
The urban cities had the highest number of total rides and total drivers of the three types of cities. Also, the total number of fares was the highest for the urban cities. Moreover, due to the high total rides and total drivers, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver was the lowest for urban cities.

### Total Fare by City Type
The total fare by city type analysis helped us discover what weeks have the highest earnings for the three different types of cities. We can conclude that urban cities earned the highest revenue over the period. Also, we discovered that urban cities also had variable earnings in consecutive weeks. Over the course of a few weeks, urban cities had trouble meeting the same target of revenue earned previous week. Also, we discovered that rural cities had the lowest amount of earning over the same period. Also after the analysis, we determined that the weekly earnings for rural cities does not fluctuate or increase alot. The total fares stay in the same range of numbers.

## Recommendations for the bussiness
After analyzing the data for Total Fare by City Type graph, I recommend we spend more money on marketing and advertisement in Suburban cities to attract more riders to use our service. The data shows that at the end of the four months, total earnings from urban cities is decreasing quite sharply and the earnings from Suburban cities stays smooth. It is wiser to promote PyBer in Suburban cities to help the revenue grow in suburban cities when the revenue is falling in urban cities. This way the company's total revenue will not take a major hit in the coming weeks. After analyzing the high number of total drivers in urban cities compared to the total rides, I also recommend coming up with an incentive scheme for drivers in these cities to do their rides in rural cities. This will help bring down the average fare per driver in rural cities and also help easily meet the total demand. Lastly, it's quite clear that the total fares for Urban cities is the highest. Being the highest revenue stream, this region cannot be neglected. I recommend we spend some time and money into analysing why the revenue earnings are not stable. We need to find out what are we doing right in the weeks with the higher revenue. After figuring out what it is, we need to make sure we do the same in the other weeks to maintain a stable and high revenue stream from urban cities.
